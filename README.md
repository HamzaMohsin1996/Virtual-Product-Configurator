# Virtual Product Configurator

Virtual Product Configurator is a web application that allows users to explore and customize 3D models of various products. The application currently showcases three products: Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Mercedes G-Wagon, and customizable shoes. Users can interact with the 3D models, rotate them, and customize their colors based on personal preferences.

## Overview

This application enables users to visualize and personalize 3D models of different products. It features an intuitive user interface with a header containing links to each product, facilitating easy navigation between them. Users can interact with the 3D models by rotating them and adjusting the colors of various components to explore different customization options.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: Frontend framework for building the user interface
- Three.js: Library for creating and displaying 3D graphics in the browser
- react-three-fiber: React renderer for Three.js
- react-colorful: Color picker component for selecting colors
- Valtio: Library for state management
- react-router-dom: Library for routing within the application
